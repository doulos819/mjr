## Preface
> [Number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory) is the study of [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer) and the relations between them. [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss) (1777 − 1855) allegedly said that mathematics is the queen of the sciences and that number theory is the queen of mathematics.
