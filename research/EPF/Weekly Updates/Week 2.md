### Wednesday
- Coursera
	- Was flying, so spent a lot of the time going through lectures.
### Thursday -> Friday/Weekend
- Currently at ch 4 of the text and the 4th module of the Coursera course 
- For the CE text
	- Main goal is to take useful notes for the [CE study group](https://twitter.com/uncloakcrypto/status/1591117127196749825?s=20&t=mUfu_X7siCIHKou6zyf_cw)
	- Notes should eventually live @ uncloak.org
	- Support the knowledge graph for CE and get more blockchain/Ethereum specific as the graph grows
- Coursera 
	- Relatively enjoyable. There are a lot of online resources so that a participant never has to truly feel stuck on any topic. 
	- Very "stick to what exists" vibe, which is understandable. Imo, the web3 space allows for a potential subset of CEs that want to push the boundaries though.
	- The lectures explain things well, the quiz questions cover a wide area of knowledge (although would appreciate more support with understanding WHY something is correct/incorrect; video examples maybe)
	- Programming assignments are in python, bit code examples are easy to ready and understand regardless. 

### Thoughts 
- Going to be changing up the format of my weekly updates going forward since I am finally starting to galvanise around a project idea.
