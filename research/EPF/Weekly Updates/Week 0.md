### Project Setup & Learning

#### Intro
- My name is [Chloe](https//:marmaj.org/chloe), and I am very excited to be taking part in the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship over the next 4 months ([specifically cohort 3](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/blob/master/program-guide/program-details.md)).
- My background is in Research more than engineering, but I hope to use the next four months to try and bridge the gap.
- My main areas of interest are privacy/zk (specifically validator privacy)
- Hours of availability 8am-5pm EST

#### Goals
- Better understanding of implementing practical cryptography in systems [[Cryptography Engineering - 2010]]
	- Start up Crypto Eng Study Group
- Be able to support a team to implement protocol specs in Rust [[Zero2Prod (in Rust) - 2022]] (or at least how users interact with the protocol) (Wakuv2?)
- Some teams I am interested in:
	- [Status](https://status.im/) - resource constant devices 
	- [Vacp2p](https://vac.dev/) - private messaging
	- [Portal Network](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs) - light clients

#### Plans
- Work with [Thor](https://twitter.com/cryptograthor) as my mentor as I work to implement cryptography widgets in Rust
	- Uncloak - Build Rust backend to host educational content. 
	- Cryptography engineering [study group](https://discord.gg/gVAaf8kH) soon™️  
- Curate [[Reading List]] (https://hackmd.io/@chloethedev/ryNXAOB4j) and have efficient notes on many of the resources.

### Pre-Fellowship
- Was spent choosing a mentor (Thor), and starting to go through the reading materials. I also have been gathering resources to support with the "Project" that I hope to work on over the next 4 months (and hopefully beyond). 
- Also trying to focus on some personal goals over the next 4 months to try and not burn out... again...:
	- Attempt to stick to ~20h/w (also m-f)
	- Learn in a community as much as possible
		- Open office hours & study groups
- Lots of brushing up on Rust/Number Theory

## Week 0 (oct 24-2022)

### Monday 
- Get started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
	- Relatively efficient so far
	- Useful for having data stored locally
	- Brushing up on [LaTeX](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html)
- Working through a bit of [[Cryptography Engineering - 2010]]
	- Reading progress: ch3
	- Streaming progress: ch2
- Set up [Reading list](https://hackmd.io/@chloethedev/ryNXAOB4j)
  
### Tuesday
  - Held [office hours](https://marmaj.org/events/marma-j-research-dao-office-hours/)
	  - Discussed with HS student who was interested in becoming ETH Researcher and she will join CE study group
