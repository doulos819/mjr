	- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives): Go through [Euler in Rust](https://github.com/doulos819/euler-rust) for a good "rusty math" background 
		- todo()
	- Video support (helps provide an understanding of the flow)

### Week highlights

#### Monday
- Spent the day continuing [Corsera crypto course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto). Completed module 4 and should complete the entire course by the start of Week-4.

#### Tuesday
- Uncloak team call: discussed contributor flow
	- Thor will work on the contributor guide
	- I will work on a "Contributing to Uncloak using GitHub." guide to be linked/included. 
	- To work on picking out topics from CE text to eventually add to Uncloak.org
- [Study group](https://twitter.com/uncloakcrypto/status/1591117127196749825?s=20&t=mUfu_X7siCIHKou6zyf_cw) starts Friday Nov 18th: no specifics for format yet, but attempting to cater to hundreds of individuals while focusing on the core group that will complete the course.  
- Learning a lot from Euler in Rust vids so wanna finish [this one](https://youtu.be/2NPX6v0qqp0) today.
	- Thursday to start working on [the repo](https://github.com/doulos819/euler-rust)

My grandmother passed away Nov 18th which was the same day as the first study group session. The session went well overall, some notes:
- Need better connectivity regardless of environment
- Would like to set up an Uncloak YT channel for simple OBS stream of whatever platform and then to YT.
- Many people have suggested https://www.descript.com/ as an efficient option for this type of MOOC set up (more for recordings, less for streams it seems)

I am also helping to lead a small (10 person) exercise group.
- week 1 https://hackmd.io/@thor314/H12nS4SLj
- repo: https://github.com/doulos819/uncloak-cesg 

Goal is to work on the exercises over the weekends on my own, start getting support from mentor early in the week, work with small group on exercises mid week, and submit pr to github repo on friday right before the class.

This will reflect in the [EPF project](https://github.com/doulos819/mjr/blob/main/research/EPF/Project-Uncloak.md) submission.
