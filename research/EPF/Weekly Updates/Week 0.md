### Project Setup & Learning

#### Intro
- My name is [Chloe](https//:marmaj.org/chloe), and I am very excited to be taking part in the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship over the next 4 months ([specifically cohort 3](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/blob/master/program-guide/program-details.md)).
- My background is in Research more than engineering, but I hope to use the next four months to try and bridge the gap.
- My main areas of interest are privacy (specifically validator privacy)

#### Goals
- Better understanding of implementing practical cryptography in systems [[Cryptography Engineering - 2010]]
- Be able to support a team to implement protocol specs in Rust [[Zero2Prod (in Rust) - 2022]] (or at least how users interact with the protocol)
- Some teams I am interested in:
	- [Status](https://status.im/)
	- [Vacp2p](https://vac.dev/)
	- 

#### Plans
- Work with [Thor](https://twitter.com/cryptograthor) as my mentor as I work to implement cryptography widgets in Rust
	- Uncloak 
	- Educational resources for those interested in zk
- Curate Reading list for "Validator Privacy"

### Monday 
- Get started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
	- Relatively efficient so far
	- Useful for having data stored locally
	- Brushing up on [LaTeX](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html)
	-
