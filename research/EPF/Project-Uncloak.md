# Uncloak: Cryptography Engineering Knowledge Graph Support
> Project Website: https://uncloak.org/ 
> Study Group Syllabus: https://hackmd.io/@thor314/ryEWRY6Qs

Hello, I am Chloe, and I hope to support the Ethereum community (and the general cryptography engineering community) by making meaningful contributions to the [Uncloak Knowledge Graph (currently focused on cryptography](https://uncloak.org/Topic-Cryptography)).

This project can be broken into two distinct, yet related, parts.
1. Study Group (this doc will focus on this aspect of the project and most info can be found in the [syllabus](https://hackmd.io/@thor314/ryEWRY6Qs)).
2. Contributions to the knowledge graph (on the actual [Uncloak site]( https://uncloak.org/ )).

## Motivation

Learning materials on cryptography engineering are scattered, out of date, or generally inaccessible for most developers. Rust has taken the cryptography world by storm, but resources on Rust-based cryptography engineering are few and far between. Training in cryptography does not belong behind closed doors. 

Facilitating the aggregation, connection, and transfer of technical knowledge is the high level motivation. The Ethereum protocol will hopefully be positively affected by this project; as new protocol engineers delve into the technical resources required for their individual projects, they will be able to turn to the Uncloak knowledge graph for support. The main goal though, is to support all cryptography engineers, regardless of the protocol they would like to work on. 

## Project description

A 4-month, open to the public, Rust Cryptography Engineering weekly study group, covering topics in [_Cryptography Engineering: Design Principles and Practical Applications_](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1506sz7G5o6ATeGObP1AEwMV4msaLK3HD?usp=sharing), and other materials as necessary. The group will have optional weekly programming assignments for practice. We will meet in the [Uncloak Discord](https://discord.gg/TYwr4pMS2h).

Learn cryptography with a community of enthusiasts and practitioners. Experience with Rust will be helpful but not required. See the [Uncloak Discord Rust Channel](https://discord.gg/TYwr4pMS2h) for some recommended starting resources on Rust.  Shared notes for the study group will live in this [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@thor314/rJYOqK6Qo), and the [Uncloak Graph](https://uncloak.org/).

[Practical Cryptography for Developers](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/) and [Number Theory Explained From First Principles](https://explained-from-first-principles.com/number-theory/) are recommended as supplemental resources.

## Specification
How will you implement your solutions? Give details and more technical information on the project.

Syllabus: https://hackmd.io/@thor314/ryEWRY6Qs#Syllabus
Repo for class exercises: https://github.com/doulos819/uncloak-cesg

For the study group:
- Class details are posted to HackMD (for example, [here is the syllabus](https://hackmd.io/@thor314/ryEWRY6Qs#Syllabus))
- Community participation or organization is in the [Uncloak discord](https://discord.gg/b8J9ERVZ5z).
- Knowledge graph is starting with an [Obsidian site](https://uncloak.org/).


## Roadmap

- In 4 months we will have the first iteration of the course complete and can assess how to improve to a potential next iteration. 
- Knowledge graph should have basic additions for [cryptography topic](https://uncloak.org/Topic-Cryptography).

## Possible challenges

- Hundreds of interested individuals, how to accommodate efficiently facilitating their needs.
- Trying to balance between building & educating/supporting.
- Managing mischievous actors in the public learning space.
- Attempting to efficiently organize community knowledge graph contributions. 

## Goal of the project

- MOOC / Course that can expand to continue to support more individuals. 
- Knowledge graph expanding to more technical topics (blockchain specific or potentially outside of cryptography entirely).
- Would like to be able to lead the class the next time it runs.
- Train Rust cryptography engineers to support be able to educate themselves with a community to support the learning journey. 
- Build an open source knowledge graph for technical topics. 

## Collaborators

### Fellows

Where are currently no other fellows working on this project with me, but I have spoken to a few fellows who are interested in attending the study group.

### Mentors

None of the [EPF Mentors](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/blob/master/program-guide/mentors.md) are supporting me with this project in an official capacity. I am working with Thor k. to support his vision behind
