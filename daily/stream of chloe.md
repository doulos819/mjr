Seems difficult to try and refine an idea/concept that doesn't take solid shape often. Something about feeling free. I suppose it starts by being brave enough to start and courageous enough to keep going. Today I will start, and tomorrow I hope to continue. 
Tired, but going strong. Not all of the answers are easily found, but those are the most interesting questions. Being free, feeling free. Supporting our local community. Keep going, but where? I do not think that I am fully aware of where I want to go. I DO want to support, why thought? I guess because that is what God told me to do.
