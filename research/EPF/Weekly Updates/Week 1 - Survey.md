### Survey of Current Resources
> Last week: Decided on general EPF project theme. Educational resources to support the learning pathway of perspective cryptography engineers. 
> This week: Survey of current applied cryptography/zk resources to aid in applying cryptography.

**Potential Problem:** There are many publicly available resources that are efficient at explaining how current (and historical) cryptographic systems work. There are also thorough courses available to support structured learning to teach core cryptography concepts. While these resources exist, it can take more time than is available (or reasonable) for engineers interested in learning to apply cryptography to go through them all (or to know where to find efficient resources).

**Potential Solution:** Create a resource that combines many already available resources, while also providing relevant examples that learners can interact with and build upon.

### Monday
- [Crypto Engineering - 2010](https://github.com/doulos819/mjr/blob/main/research/Notes/books/Cryptography%20Engineering%20-%202010.md)
	- Finish ch 3 this week & start doing exercises.
- [ZK Whiteboard Sessions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj80z0cJm8QErn3akRcqvxUsyXWC81OGq)
	- Vid 1 (weekend), 2, & 3.

- [A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography](https://toc.cryptobook.us/book.pdf)
	- Started reading through text (pg 8)
	- Seems like an efficient pairing to CE - 2010. Valuable definitions, proofs, and mathematical exercises. 
	- More important than general notes would be finding definitions or proofs to help understand larger ideas & understanding the text/proofs.
